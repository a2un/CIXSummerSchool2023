# A primer on Geometric Optimization

This part of the CIX summer school will be taught in C++ using geometry processing libraries (i.e., [libigl](https://libigl.github.io/tutorial/))

**Find all instructions here: https://github.com/alexiiion/teach-geometric-optimization**

Please install all components (editor, compiler, Boost libs, CMake) **by Monday.** Test using the `0_compilation_test` binary.

Test you environtment and tool chain early, since some dependencies are large (e.g. Boost) and depending on your choice of programming environment (e.g. IDE) setup can take some time and space to install.

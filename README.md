# 7th Summer School on Computational Interaction 2023 

This git repository accompanies the 7th Summer School on Computational Interaction which will be held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. It will take place June 19 – 23, 2023. 

This summer school teaches students computational methods and their application in user interface design, optimization, and evaluation. Each day will feature one or two outstanding speakers who will share their expertise on a technical topic relevant to Computational Interaction. Keynote speakers will introduce the theme of this year’s school. Individual lectures will give students an overview of different topics in Computational Interaction, and will include exercises that will give students hands-on experience with Computational Interaction research. See our lineup of exciting speakers this year!
